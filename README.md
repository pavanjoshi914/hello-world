# HELLO-WOLRD

hii there, i am PAVAN.i am always fascinated for a open source development and working with others in a community.
i have interest in development of API's(front end and backend),android apps and  application softwares.

Journey of a individual in the  PROGRAMMING WORLD start with hello-world program.
By working on hello-world project we can learn how to add a branch ,how to make a commit and many more 

SOME IMPORTANT TERMS:

1>REPOSITORY:
While working on a single project, we organise such project in terms of repository.
Repository contains all the files,codes,read-me,images,your own ideas about projects etc.

2>BRANCHING:
It is the way of working on different versions of repository at one time.(it is just copy of a MASTER to experiment with it)
Initial/Default version of a repository is named as MASTER (also known as definitive branch).
We create branch of a repository called as FEATURE,experiment on that branch and if desidered things are got we can commit it to master.
*If changes are made in master branch we can pull all those updates in our created branches of master.

    SOME IMPORTANT STEPS BEFORE MERGING FEATURE INTO MASTER:
    1>Create feature from master branch.
    2>Commit changes.
    3>Submit a pull request.
    4>Have some discussions about made changes with other contributors.
    5>Merge feature branch into master.
    
    Here at GitHub, contributors use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master
    (production) branch. 
    When a change is ready, they merge their branch into master

3>COMMITS:
Any saved changes created in a feature is called as a commit.
Each commit posses a corresponding commit message,it represents other contributors what and why a particular change is done.

4>PULL REQUESTS:
 PULL REQUEST ARE THE WAY OF ENGAGING WITH OTHER CONTRIBUTORS ON A PARTICULAR PROJECTS.
 For a particular project we can open a pull request.
 It is a process of proposing changes that you have made to others for a review and pull in our  contribution and 
   merge them into their branch.
 As soon we make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
 By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, we can ask for feedback from specific people or teams.
 we can even open pull requests in our own repository and merge them ourself. 
 It’s a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.
     
 
 5>MERGING FEATURE INTO MASTER BRANCH:
   It is last step,by merging feature into master we get all the changes that we done in feature into master branch.
